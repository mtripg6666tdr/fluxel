# Fluxel - Tiny, Fast, and Delightful DOM Building Library

Fluxel is an ultra-lightweight and high-performance DOM-building library inspired by the simplicity of React's JSX and the DOM API. It enables the creation of reactive UIs, offers strong type safety via TypeScript, and provides a pleasant developer and user experience‚Äîall with a surprisingly small footprint.

## Features

* üí° **Intuitive API (Functional & JSX)**: You can create elements using tag-based functions like `Fluxel.div()` and `Fluxel.span()`. For those who prefer declarative code, Fluxel also supports optional React-like JSX syntax (`<div />`). Both styles allow for efficient UI building.
* ‚ö° **High-Performance DOM Updates / Reactive System**: Fluxel features a state-driven reactivity system that automatically updates the UI when the state changes. Without relying on a virtual DOM, it updates only the specific DOM nodes linked to the changed state, achieving exceptional performance.
* üß© **`Fluxel.fragment`**: A utility that allows grouping multiple children without introducing unnecessary wrapper elements in the DOM. It can intelligently propagate attributes (especially `classList` and event handlers) to its children.
* üèóÔ∏è **`Fluxel.createComponent` / `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent`**: Lightweight abstractions for defining reusable UI components. You can clearly define both stateless and reactive components.
* üçÉ **Lightweight Modular Design**: With zero dependencies and a modular structure, you can selectively include reactive features or JSX support based on your development needs. This enables minimal bundling, faster load times, and maximum performance.

## Installation

```sh
npm install fluxel
# or
yarn add fluxel
```

### Importing

Once installed, you can import Fluxel and start using it immediately.
Fluxel provides multiple import modules based on your needs:

|                    |   Functional API  |       JSX Syntax      |
| :----------------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: |
| Without Reactivity |      `fluxel`     |           -           |
|   With Reactivity  | `fluxel/reactive` | `fluxel/jsx-reactive` |

All APIs available in `fluxel` are also available in the other modules.
Likewise, everything in `fluxel/reactive` is also accessible from `fluxel/jsx-reactive`.

Fluxel supports both CommonJS and ESModules. If using CommonJS, note that the `default` property corresponds to the default export of ESModules:

```js
// CommonJS example
const Fluxel = require('fluxel').default;
```

### JSX Setup

To use JSX with Fluxel, you‚Äôll need a JSX-compatible compiler. Here's an example using the TypeScript compiler:

Update your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "fluxel"
  }
}
```

This uses the modern React runtime. Fluxel supports both the new and legacy React runtimes.
To use the legacy one, set `"jsx": "react"`, and configure `"jsxFactory"` and `"jsxFragment"` like this:

```json
{
  "jsxFactory": "Fluxel.jsx.createElement",
  "jsxFragment": "Fluxel.jsx.Fragment"
}
```

Then import Fluxel in all files like so:

```ts
import Fluxel from "fluxel/jsx-reactive-legacy";
```

### Installation via CDN

Instead of installing via package managers like npm, you can load it directly into your HTML from a CDN.

* If you don't need reactivity, paste the following into your `<head>`:
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fluxel@x.x/dist/browser/fluxel.min.js"></script>
  ```

* If reactivity is required, paste the following into your `<head>`:
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fluxel@x.x/dist/browser/fluxel-reactive.min.js"></script>
  ```

Please replace `x.x` with the appropriate version number.

## Usage

### Basic Functional API Example

```tsx
import Fluxel from 'fluxel';

const myDiv = Fluxel.div('Hello, World!');
document.body.appendChild(myDiv); // <div>Hello, World!</div>

const button = Fluxel.button({
  children: 'Click Me!',
  onclick: () => console.log('Button clicked!'),
  style: { backgroundColor: 'dodgerblue', color: 'white', padding: '10px' },
  classList: ['btn', 'btn-primary'],
  dataset: { action: 'submit' }
});
document.body.appendChild(button);
```

### Basic Functional API Example with Native DOM Reactivity
This is a minimal example of `ToDo List` without fluxel's reactivity.
```js
import Fluxel from "fluxel";

const TodoItem = Fluxel.createComponent(({ text }) => Fluxel.div([
  Fluxel.input({
      type: "checkbox",
      onchange: e => e.target.closest("div").querySelector("span").style.textDecoration = e.target.checked ? "line-through" : "",
  }),
  Fluxel.span(text),
  Fluxel.a({
      onclick: e => e.target.closest("div").remove(),
      children: "‚ùå",
  }),
]));

const TodoList = Fluxel.createComponent(() => {
  const todoInput = Fluxel.input({ type: "text", placeholder: "New todo..." });

  const dom = Fluxel.div([
      todoInput,
      Fluxel.button({
          onclick: () => {
              dom.appendChild(TodoItem({ text: todoInput.value.trim() }));
              todoInput.value = ""; // Clear the input field.
          },
          children: "Add"
      }),
  ]);
  return dom;
});

document.body.appendChild(TodoList());
```

<!--
### Basic Functional API Example with Fluxel's Reactivity
```ts

```
-->

### Basic JSX Example

```tsx
// src/index.tsx
import Fluxel, { type FluxelJSXElement } from "fluxel/jsx-reactive";

const MyComponent = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent((_, state) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    state.count++;
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Fluxel Counter</h1>
      <p>Count: {state.use("count")}</p>
      <button onclick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}, { count: 0 });

document.getElementById('app')!.appendChild(Fluxel.ensureNode(<MyComponent />));
```

Use the `ensureNode` function to convert a `FluxelJSXElement` into a DOM Node:

```tsx
import Fluxel, { type FluxelJSXElement } from "fluxel/jsx-reactive";

const instance: FluxelJSXElement = <MyComponent />;
const node: Node = Fluxel.ensureNode(instance);
```

### Using `classList`

When handling the `class` attribute, use the `classList` property in Fluxel. It supports both strings and arrays of strings‚Äîincluding reactive values‚Äîallowing for flexible and dynamic class management.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Do not use `className`; use `classList` instead for advanced and reactive functionality.

```tsx
import Fluxel from 'fluxel/reactive';

const MyComponent = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent((_, state) => {
  const toggleActive = () => {
    state.isActive = !state.isActive;
  };

  return (
    <button
      onclick={toggleActive}
      classList={['button', state.use('isActive', active => active ? 'active' : '')]}
      style={{ padding: '10px', margin: '5px' }}
    >
      Click Me ({state.use('isActive', active => active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive')})
    </button>
  );
}, { isActive: false });

document.body.appendChild(Fluxel.ensureNode(<MyComponent />));
```

### Using `fragment` (`Fluxel.fragment`)

`Fluxel.fragment` allows grouping multiple elements without wrapping them in an extra DOM element. In addition, attributes and event handlers can be propagated to child elements.

#### Functional API Example

```ts
import Fluxel from 'fluxel';

const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Fragment children clicked!');
};

const myFragment = Fluxel.fragment(
  [
    Fluxel.button('Static Button 1'),
    Fluxel.button('Static Button 2'),
    Fluxel.p('This is a static paragraph.')
  ],
  {
    onclick: handleClick,
    style: {
      margin: '5px',
      padding: '8px',
      border: '1px solid blue',
      borderRadius: '8px'
    },
    classList: ['fragment-group']
  }
);

document.body.appendChild(myFragment);
```

#### JSX Example

You can utilize the `Fragment` component, which wraps `Fluxel.fragment` as a JSX-compatible component. `Fragment` can be utilized via named import from `fluxel/jsx-reactive`.

```tsx
import Fluxel, { Fragment } from "fluxel/jsx-reactive";

const ClickableItemsJSX = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent(
  (_, state) => {
    const handleClick = () => {
      state.clicks++;
    };

    return (
      <Fragment
        onclick={handleClick}
        style={{
          margin: '5px',
          padding: '8px',
          border: '1px solid green',
          borderRadius: '8px'
        }}
        classList={['fragment-group-jsx']}
      >
        <button>Click Me 1 (JSX)</button>
        <button>Click Me 2 (JSX)</button>
        <p>Total Clicks (JSX): {state.use('clicks', clicks => `${clicks}`)}</p>
      </Fragment>
    );
  },
  { clicks: 0 }
);

document.getElementById('app')!.appendChild(Fluxel.ensureNode(<ClickableItemsJSX />));
```

### Components (`Fluxel.createComponent` / `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent`)

Fluxel allows you to define reusable UI parts as components. This improves code modularity, readability, and maintainability.

#### Basing Example

```tsx
// src/index.ts
import Fluxel from "fluxel/jsx-reactive"; // Import this when using JSX
// Even when using the functional API, `Fluxel.createComponent` and `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` can be used by importing from 'fluxel' or 'fluxel/reactive'.
// (Note: `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` is only available when importing from reactive modules.)

const MyComponent = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent((_, state) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    state.count++;
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Fluxel Counter</h1>
      <p>Count: {state.use("count")}</p>
      <button onclick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}, { count: 0 });

document.getElementById('app')!.appendChild(Fluxel.ensureNode(<MyComponent />));
```

#### Component Overview

Fluxel components come in two types: `Fluxel.createComponent` (stateless) and `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` (stateful). Both function as functional components, accepting Props and returning Fluxel elements (DOM nodes or reactive values).

The signatures for these two functions are as follows:

```ts
// Stateless component
Fluxel.createComponent(renderer: (props: P) => ReturnType);

// Stateful component
Fluxel.createStatefulComponent(renderer: (props: P, state: StateParam<S>) => ReturnType, initialState: S | ((props: P) => S));
```

* `props`: An object containing data passed from the parent component. Props are generally considered **immutable** within the component. Directly changing the values of props will not trigger re-rendering or reactive updates. (This is due to the component's lifecycle; please refer to the section on lifecycle later for details.) If the parent component provides a **reactive value (an instance of `ReactiveDependency`)** obtained via `state.use()` or similar (e.g., via `parentState.use()`), the child component can react to its changes by calling `derive()` from that reactive value.

* `state`: An object representing the component's internal reactive state. When you directly change a `state` property's value, such as `state.propertyName = value`, Fluxel automatically detects the change and updates the associated UI. This is only available via `createStatefulComponent`.

* `initialState`: Sets the initial value of the component's internal reactive state. In addition to initializing with a fixed value, you can also set `initialState` based on the values of props. In this case, `initialState` should be a function that accepts props and returns the initial value for the reactive state.

#### Reactive State and `ReactiveDependency` Objects

The core of Fluxel's reactive system lies in its mechanism for detecting state changes and automatically updating the UI accordingly.

* **Reactive State**:
  The `state` object of components defined with `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` has reactive properties. This means that by simply changing a property's value directly, such as `state.propertyName = newValue`, Fluxel detects the change and automatically updates the associated UI elements. Developers can focus on state management without manually manipulating the DOM.

* **`ReactiveDependency` Object**:
  Calling `state.use("propertyName")` returns not the **current value** of that property itself, but a **dependency (`ReactiveDependency` object)** for updating the UI when that value changes. This `ReactiveDependency` object is like a "reference" to a reactive value; when its value changes, the UI elements dependent on it are automatically re-rendered.

  For example, `state.use("count")` retrieves not the current value of the `count` state itself, but a "reference" to the `count` state. This provides a mechanism to update its display when it changes.

  Furthermore, the `ReactiveDependency` object has a `derive()` method. This allows you to "derive" new reactive values from existing ones. By calling this method, the derived value can also track changes in the existing reactive value.

  ```ts
  const myReactiveValue = state.use("someProperty"); // This returns a ReactiveDependency object
  const derivedValue = myReactiveValue.derive(val => `Derived value: ${val}`); // Derive a new ReactiveDependency
  // If this derivedValue is bound to the UI, it will be updated every time myReactiveValue changes.
  ```

  You can also concisely write `derive()` in the form of `state.use("propertyName", deriveFn)`. In this case, `deriveFn` will be executed every time the value of `propertyName` changes, and its return value will be reflected in the UI. This behaves almost identically to calling the `derive()` method.
  The clear distinction between `state.use("propertyName", deriveFn)` and `state.use("propertyName").derive()` calls is whether a memoization function is passed as the second argument to `deriveFn`. Further details about memoization functions will be provided later.

  ```ts
  // This will result in the same outcome as the derive() example above.
  const derivedValue = state.use("someProperty", val => `Derived value: ${val}`);
  ```

  If you were to write ``const derivedValue = `Derived Value: ${state.someProperty}` `` here, and then bind this `derivedValue` to the UI, the UI would not update even if `state.someProperty` changes.

#### Component Lifecycle

Fluxel components have a simple lifecycle, centered around initial setup and subsequent reactive updates.

1.  **Initialization (When `Fluxel.createComponent` / `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` is called)**:

  * The `renderer` function is executed **only once** when the component instance is first created.

  * During this initial execution, a direct dependency map linking UI elements and state properties is built through `state.use()` calls within the `renderer`.

  * `initialState` (or the function passed to `initialState`) is evaluated, and the component's internal reactive state is set.

2.  **Reactive Updates (Upon State Change)**:

  * After initialization, the `renderer` function is **never re-executed**.

  * Instead, when a state property changes (e.g., `state.count++`), Fluxel leverages the dependency map built during initialization.

  * Only specific DOM elements or attributes directly linked to the changed state property via `state.use` are updated. This is a direct, push-based update to the DOM.

3. **Props Updates (Upon Parent Component Change)**:

    * If the parent component passes a `ReactiveDependency` as a Prop, and that `ReactiveDependency` changes, the child component's UI can react to that change if it has integrated that Prop into its own reactive system using `props.yourPropName.derive()`. The child component's `renderer` itself is not re-executed due to Prop changes; only the derived values are updated.

This simple lifecycle minimizes redundant calculations and DOM operations, focusing updates directly on the reactive parts, thereby ensuring high performance.

#### Notes on Prop Changes

If a Prop's value can change over time from the parent, and the child component needs to reactively update based on these changing Props (e.g., for derived calculations or conditional rendering dependent on the **current** value of the Prop), then that Prop must be mapped into the component's internal reactive system using `props.yourPropName.derive()`.

**Important**: The `props` object itself is **not reactive**. Its values are set once per rendering cycle by the parent. To react to changes in a `prop` value passed as a `ReactiveDependency` from the parent, you must create a new reactive dependency within the child component using `props.yourPropName.derive()`.


```ts
import Fluxel from 'fluxel/reactive';

// This component manages a reactive message and passes it as a Prop.
const ParentComponent = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent(
  (props, state) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      state.message = "Message updated!";
    }, 2000);

    return Fluxel.div([
      Fluxel.h2('Parent Component'),
      // Use state.use and the derive function for string interpolation
      // Alternatively, pass ReactiveDependency directly if it's a single child element
      Fluxel.p(state.use('message', msg => `Parent's current message: ${msg}`)),
      // Pass ReactiveDependency directly as a Prop to the child.
      DisplayMessage({ receivedMessage: state.use('message') }),
    ]);
  },
  { message: "Hello from parent!" }
);

// This component reacts to Props passed as ReactiveDependency.
const DisplayMessage = Fluxel.createComponent(
  (props) => {
    // Create a new ReactiveDependency using props.receivedMessage.derive().
    // This ensures updates whenever the parent's `message` (ReactiveDependency) changes.
    const displayValue = props.receivedMessage.derive(msg => {
      return msg ? `Child displays: "${msg}"` : "Child displays: (No message)";
    });

    return Fluxel.div({
      style: { border: '1px dashed #ccc', padding: '10px', margin: '10px 0', borderRadius: '8px' },
      children: [
        Fluxel.h3('Display Message Component'),
        Fluxel.p(displayValue), // Use the derived reactive value
      ],
    });
  } // This component does not require its own internal state.
);

document.body.appendChild(ParentComponent());
```

#### Memoization within Components

Fluxel's reactivity model ensures high efficiency by directly patching only the parts of the DOM where state changes occur. However, the `renderer` function of `Fluxel.createComponent` and `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` is executed only once during initialization, and the `deriveFn` of `state.use` is re-executed when its dependencies change. In certain scenarios, this can lead to unnecessary regeneration of DOM elements or re-execution of expensive calculations within reactive blocks.

This is where the `memo` function comes in. Its design is specialized for Fluxel's unique "single renderer execution" model and push-based update strategy, differing from typical Virtual DOM frameworks.

* **Optimization within Reactive Blocks**: If you expand the scope of `state.use` for code readability or component structure (e.g., conditionally rendering entirely different elements like "Stop" and "Start/Resume" buttons in a timer UI), the entire DOM block might be regenerated even if only a small part or none of the output has changed. Using `memo` within that reactive block can prevent the regeneration of specific unchanging elements or the re-execution of expensive calculations, ensuring optimal performance without sacrificing code clarity.

* **Targeted Usage**: `memo` is tightly integrated with the dependency digestion process of `state.use`. This means that memoized data is managed per `state.use` call. The intention is to apply memoization precisely where direct state dependencies trigger re-evaluation, and this memoization feature is not a general-purpose caching mechanism for arbitrary function calls.

* The `memo` function is available within `state.use`'s `deriveFn` in the form of `memo(factory, deps, pure?)`. This function caches the result of the `factory` function as long as `deps` (dependency array) does not change. This helps optimize expensive calculations and DOM element generation. To correctly associate with memoized data, the number of calls to this function must not change within the same component. If the `pure` option is set to `true`, more strict memoization becomes possible by stringifying the dependency array to generate a cache key. This allows for efficient reuse of existing DOM nodes and maximizes performance even when elements in a list are added, removed, or reordered. Note that when the `pure` option is enabled, the number of `memo` function calls can be changed.

  ```tsx
  // Code returning elements within the component's renderer function
  // Each <li> element for a ToDo item will not be regenerated unless todo.id and todo.completed change.
  return (
    <ul>
      {state.use("todos", (currentTodos, memo) =>
        currentTodos.map(todo => memo(() => (
          <li>
            <span onclick={() => toggleTodo(todo.id)} classList={todo.completed ? 'completed' : ''}>
              {todo.text}
            </span>
            <button onclick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}>Delete</button>
          </li>
        ), [todo.id, todo.completed], true))
        // pure = true enables strict memoization and element reuse. When pure = true,
        // the number of memo function calls within deriveFn does not need to be the same each time.
      )}
    </ul>
  );
  ```

### Creating an unique identifier (`Fluxel.useUniqueString`)

`Fluxel.useUniqueString` helps generate unique strings that can be used for HTML element attributes like `id` and `htmlFor`, simplifying accessibility for form elements and more. This function accepts a callback function as an argument, and the generated unique ID is passed as a string to this callback.

```tsx
import Fluxel from "fluxel/jsx";

const MyForm = Fluxel.createComponent(() => {
  return Fluxel.useUniqueString((inputId) => (
    <form>
      <label htmlFor={inputId}>Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id={inputId} name="name" />
    </form>
  ));
});

document.body.appendChild(Fluxel.ensureNode(<MyForm />));
```

### Component-Bound Static Style Injection (`Fluxel.forwardStyle`)

Fluxel.forwardStyle is a powerful utility function that allows you to dynamically insert CSS strings into the document's &lt;head&gt; at any time. This provides a flexible way to manage styles, especially for component-specific or theme-related styling.

This function accepts a single CSS string as its argument and returns nothing (void). The CSS rules provided in the string are immediately inserted into the document's &lt;head&gt; upon function call, and the styles are applied instantly.

```tsx
import Fluxel from 'fluxel';

const MyButtonComponent = Fluxel.createComponent(() => {
  // Styles are injected when this component is first rendered.
  Fluxel.forwardStyle(`
    .my-button {
      background-color: #007bff;
    }
    .my-button:hover {
      background-color: #0056b3;
    }
  `);

  return Fluxel.button({
    classList: ['my-button'],
    children: 'Click Me'
  });
});
```

**Key Features & Benefits:**

* **Dynamic Style Insertion**: Insert CSS rules into the &lt;head&gt; at any point during the application's lifecycle, enabling dynamic styling based on user interactions or application state.  
* **Automatic Deduplication**: The function performs deduplication by comparing the exact CSS string. If the same CSS string is passed multiple times, it will only be inserted into the &lt;head&gt; once, preventing redundant style tags.  
* **Immediate Application**: Styles are applied instantly when the forwardStyle function is called.  
* **Component-Specific Styling (Initial Load)**: It is particularly suitable for injecting common styles that a component needs when it is first initialized. This helps manage styles that are logically tied to a component.

**Important Considerations:**

* **No Deletion Functionality**: Once a style string is inserted via forwardStyle, there is no built-in function to remove it from the &lt;head&gt;.  
* **No Scoping**: Styles inserted by forwardStyle are applied globally to the entire document. There is no automatic mechanism for scoping styles to specific component instances or elements. Developers should manage potential style conflicts manually.  
* **Not for Unique Dynamic Styles**: This function is generally not recommended for scenarios requiring the generation of unique class names for every component instance or highly dynamic, instance-specific styling that needs to be scoped or removed. This is because once CSS is added, it cannot be deleted, leading to an accumulation of style definitions. Its primary use case is for applying a fixed set of styles that are common to a component or a specific part of the application upon its initial rendering.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Hydration

Fluxel supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and hydration.

To use server-side rendering, ensure the peer dependency, `jsdom@^29.1.0` is installed, which will be used to emulate DOM building.

```sh
npm i jsdom -D
```

This process primarily uses the following two functions:

* **renderToString**: Renders Fluxel components into an HTML string on the server side.  
* **hydrate**: Activates the HTML generated by renderToString as a Fluxel application on the client side.

#### **renderToString Function**

This function is used to render Fluxel components into an HTML string on the server side.

```tsx
// Import
import renderToString from "fluxel/ssr";

// Signature
function renderToString(
  renderer: () => Node | FluxelJSXElement,
  reactive?: boolean,
  metadata?: string,
): { dom: string; style: string; };
```
1. **renderer**:
   * Type: `() => Node | FluxelJSXElement`
   * Description: A function that returns the root element of the Fluxel component you want to render.  
2. **reactive (Optional)**:
   * Type: `boolean`
   * Description: Whether the Fluxel component you want to render has reactivity or not. Hydration is not available unless `reactive` set to `true`.
3. **metadata (Optional)**:
   * Type: `string`
   * Description: This string is added as a data-fluxel-metadata attribute to the root element of the rendered HTML (e.g., div or section). It can be used to pass specific information or state during client-side hydration.

**Return Value:**

renderToString returns an object with the following properties:

* **dom**:  
  * Type: `string`  
  * Description: The HTML string of the rendered component. The content of this dom can be placed under the application's root element (e.g., &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;) to generate a complete HTML page.  
* **style**:  
  * Type: `string`  
  * Description: A concatenated string of all CSS strings inserted by the Fluxel.forwardStyle function during SSR execution. This can be directly embedded in the HTML's &lt;head&gt; section to ensure style application on the client side.

#### **hydrate Function**

This function is used to "hydrate" (activate) an HTML element rendered on the server side as a reactive Fluxel component on the client side. This transforms static HTML into an interactive UI.

```ts
// Import
import hydrate from "fluxel/ssr/client";

// Signature
function hydrate(
  renderer: () => Node | FluxelJSXElement,
  rootElement: HTMLElement,
): void;
```
1. **renderer**:  
   * Type: `() => Node | FluxelJSXElement`  
   * Description: A function that returns the same Fluxel component root element used when generating HTML on the server side.  
2. **rootElement**:  
   * Type: `HTMLElement`  
   * Description: The root element of the HTML rendered on the server side (e.g., document.getElementById('app')). This element and its descendants will be the target of hydration.

**Return Value:**

The hydrate function returns void (nothing). Hydration is performed on the existing DOM tree and directly updates the UI.

#### **Important Considerations for SSR and Hydration**

* **Strict DOM Match Required**: For Fluxel's hydration to function correctly, the HTML rendered on the server must *strictly match* the DOM structure that Fluxel would initially render on the client side. If there's a mismatch, Fluxel's index-based hydration cannot proceed correctly, and the only recourse is to completely rebuild the DOM on the client.  
* **Developer Responsibility for Consistency**: It is crucial for developers to ensure that the rendering logic produces identical DOM structures on both the server and the client for the initial render.  
* **Handling Client-Specific Data (e.g., `localStorage`)**: If your application needs to display content that depends on client-specific data (e.g., data from `localStorage`, user preferences not available on the server), this can cause a mismatch. In such cases, it's recommended to:  
  1. Render the initial state on the server (or client) without this client-specific data.  
  2. After the initial render/hydration, use `Fluxel.schedule` to update the state with the client-specific data.  
  * **`Fluxel.schedule`**: This utility function essentially wraps the state update in a `setTimeout(..., 0)`, delaying the update until the next tick of the event loop, after initial hydration is complete. This ensures the initial DOM matches the server-rendered output.

#### **SSR and Hydration Example**

This example demonstrates a conceptual SSR flow, where the server-rendered HTML is then hydrated on the client. It shows how the code would typically be separated into different files for a real-world SSR application.

```tsx
// src/components/MyComponent.tsx  
import Fluxel from "fluxel/jsx-reactive";

export const MyComponent = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent((_, state) => {  
    // Use Fluxel.schedule to update state after hydration  
    // This ensures the initial server-rendered DOM matches,  
    // and the update happens client-side without a mismatch.  
    Fluxel.schedule(() => {  
        const clientData = localStorage.getItem("userPreference") || "Default Preference";  
        state.message = `Client data loaded: ${clientData}`;  
    });

    return (  
        <div>  
            <p>{state.use("message")}</p>  
        </div>  
    );  
}, { message: "Loading client-specific data..." }); // Initial state for SSR, will be immediately overwritten by client data

// server.ts (Conceptual Server-Side Rendering)  
// This is a simplified example. In a real server, you'd use a web framework (e.g., Express).  
import { MyComponent } from "./src/components/MyComponent"; // Import the component  
import renderToString from "fluxel/ssr";

function renderApp(): string {  
    // Render the component to a string  
    const { dom, style } = renderToString(MyComponent);

    // Construct the full HTML page  
    const html = `  
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <div id="app">

    </div>  
    <!-- Client-side JavaScript will hydrate this content -->  
    <script type="module" src="/client.js"></script>

`;  
    return html;  
}

// In a real server, you would send this HTML as a response to a client request.  
// console.log(renderApp());

// client.ts (This file would be bundled and served to the browser)  
import hydrate from "fluxel/ssr/client";  
import { MyComponent } from "./components/MyComponent"; // Import the component (after bundling)

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {  
    const appRoot = document.getElementById("app");  
    if (appRoot) {  
        // Hydrate the server-rendered content with the Fluxel component.  
        // The hydrate function will automatically find the [data-fluxel-ssr] element  
        // within the provided rootElement.  
        hydrate(MyComponent, appRoot as HTMLElement);  
    }  
});
```

#### Technical Overview

Fluxel's SSR and hydration perform "Index-Based Hydration" for lightweight and high-performance UI.

1. **Server-Side Rendering (`renderToString` Operation)**

  renderToString performs the following processes when generating HTML on the server:

  * **Virtual DOM Generation**: A virtual DOM tree is generated in an environment like jsdom.  
  * **Index Assignment**: For each `document.createElement` call, a `data-fluxel-eid` attribute (sequential numbering starting from 0) is assigned to the element. This is used to efficiently identify elements during hydration.  
  * **Metadata Assignment to Root Element**: The topmost element generated by Fluxel is assigned the following attributes:  
    * `data-fluxel-ssr="true"`: Indicates that this element was rendered server-side.  
    * `data-fluxel-e-count="{total_element_count}"`: Records the total number of elements generated.  
    * `data-fluxel-metadata="{metadata_string}"`: Records the string specified in the metadata argument of `renderToString` (empty string if not specified).  
  * **`reactive` Option**: When the reactive argument of `renderToString` is set to true, the above attributes are assigned, enabling hydration. If false or omitted, plain HTML without these attributes will be generated, and the output will not be hydratable.

  **Example of Generated HTML:**

  ```html
  <div data-fluxel-eid="9" data-fluxel-ssr="true" data-fluxel-e-count="11" data-fluxel-metadata="">  
      <h1 data-fluxel-eid="4">Fluxel ToDo List</h1>  
      <hr data-fluxel-eid="0">  
      <p data-fluxel-eid="1">This is a fragment.</p>  
      <!-- ...other elements... -->  
      <ul data-fluxel-eid="8"></ul>  
  </div>
  ```

2. **Client-Side Hydration (`hydrate` Operation)**

  hydrate activates the existing DOM tree sent from the server.

  * **createElement Hook**: It hooks into `document.createElement` calls and does not create new elements.  
  * **Index-Based Element Retrieval**: Based on `data-fluxel-eid` (index), it directly retrieves existing DOM elements using `querySelector` within the `rootElement`.  
  * **Event Handlers Only**: Only event handlers are attached to the retrieved elements.  
  * **Attribute/Style Skipping**: Attribute and style settings/comparisons are not performed. This assumes that the server-side generated state is correct.  
  * **Reactivity Establishment**: Although attribute and style settings are skipped, internal operations to make the elements reactive are performed. This allows for reusing existing DOM while building an interactive UI.  
  * **Root Element Flexibility**: Even if rootElement does not directly have the [data-fluxel-ssr] attribute, hydrate automatically searches for the immediate child with the [data-fluxel-ssr] attribute and starts hydration.

3. **Important Development Considerations**

   * **Strict DOM Match Required**: The DOM structure of the HTML rendered on the server must **strictly match** the DOM structure that Fluxel would initially render on the client. If there is a mismatch, hydration will fail, and DOM reconstruction will be necessary.  
   * **Handling Client-Specific Data**: Displaying content that depends on client-specific data (e.g., localStorage) not available on the server can cause mismatches. It is recommended to display a state independent of such data during initial rendering, and then update the state with client-specific data using Fluxel.schedule (setTimeout(..., 0)) after hydration is complete.

## Advanced Reactivity Information

Since Fluxel prioritizes lightness and direct DOM manipulation, its behavior may sometimes appear counter-intuitive at first glance.
Additionally, there are several advanced functions available that are useful for edge cases not fully covered by its design philosophy.

### Efficient List Updates (Advanced DOM Diffing and Application)

Even without using a Virtual DOM, Fluxel employs a sophisticated "direct DOM reconciliation algorithm" for lists and dynamically changing child elements. This approach aims to minimize costly DOM operations.

**Points of Operation Principle:**

When a list of child elements (the `children` property, which is a `ReactiveDependency` whose length or order may change) needs to be updated:

1.  **Direct DOM Comparison**: Instead of creating and comparing a new virtual DOM tree, Fluxel directly compares the list of updated DOM nodes with the current live DOM nodes. This eliminates the overhead of a virtual DOM layer.

2. **Smart Diffing Algorithm**:

    * **Tail-based Optimization**: First, it checks for additions or removals at the beginning or end of the list. If `newChildren` matches the beginning or end of `currentChildren`, it performs highly efficient `appendChild`, `prepend`, or `removeChild` operations only on the changed elements.

    * **Node Instance Preservation**: For more complex changes (e.g., intermediate elements, reordering), the algorithm leverages the stability of DOM node instances generated by Fluxel. It efficiently identifies existing nodes using `Node.isSameNode()`.

    * **Minimal Operations**: It strategically removes mismatched nodes from their current positions and inserts new or moved nodes into their correct places. This ensures that only the absolutely necessary `appendChild`, `removeChild`, or `insertBefore` calls are executed, avoiding the costly "clear all and re-add" strategy.

3. **Stability through Memoization (and `isSameNode`)**:
    Fluxel's core philosophy is that DOM node instances are stable by default (because the `renderer` function is executed only once). This stability is crucial for direct DOM comparison using `Node.isSameNode()`. Furthermore, using `memo` (especially when `pure: true` is used for stable element instances, as in the ToDoApp's `li` element example) prevents unchanging child elements from being recreated even if `deriveFn` is re-executed, allowing the reconciliation algorithm to efficiently identify and preserve them in the DOM.

This "direct DOM reconciliation algorithm," combined with the library's overall philosophy of stable DOM node instances, provides highly efficient updates for dynamic lists, often outperforming virtual DOM solutions by avoiding their inherent overhead.

### `TextNode` Updates vs. `HTMLElement` Updates

This library distinguishes between updating the content of a `TextNode` (which is highly efficient as only `nodeValue` is changed) and replacing an `HTMLElement` (which requires creating a new element and replacing the old one). This practical approach ensures the efficiency of general text updates without incurring the overhead of complex element reconciliation in simple cases.

### Child Element Type Stability

Fluxel prioritizes lightness and direct DOM manipulation, and thus has specific behaviors regarding the update of reactive child elements.

When dynamically switching between different types of elements using `ReactiveDependency` within a `children` array, the type of the generated DOM node (whether it's a TextNode or an HTMLElement) is determined during the **initial rendering**. In subsequent updates, the underlying DOM node's type will not change. Furthermore, changes in the number of elements in the `children` array cannot be tracked. This is because if the `children` value is an array, Fluxel's runtime builds dependencies as a fixed-length array.

* **Switching between HTMLElements**: Dynamic switching between different `HTMLElement` types (e.g., `Fluxel.hr()` and `Fluxel.span()`) is achieved by creating a new element and **replacing** the old one.

* **`TextNode` ‚áî `HTMLElement` switching is not supported**: Dynamic switching between `TextNode` and `HTMLElement` is not supported. If you need to conditionally render text or an element, you can wrap the text in an `HTMLElement` like `Fluxel.span('text content')`.

* **Conditional Rendering of Components**: If you need to change the length of `children`, such as conditionally showing or hiding components within the `children` array, you can either make the entire dynamic `children` array reactive, or use an empty element like `Fluxel.span()` when the component is not to be displayed.

### Triggering Side Effects by Monitoring State Changes (`state.listenTarget`)

Through the state object's `state.listenTarget` (`EventTarget`), you can subscribe to changes in specific state properties as events. This allows you to manage side effects associated with state changes, such as saving to LocalStorage or integrating with external APIs, in a clean and loosely coupled manner.

```ts
// Monitor state changes and execute side effects
state.listenTarget.addEventListener('count', (event: Event) => {
  const customEvent = event as CustomEvent<{ oldValue: number, newValue: number }>;
  console.log(`Count changed from ${customEvent.detail.oldValue} to ${customEvent.detail.newValue}`);
  // Example: localStorage.setItem('myCount', String(customEvent.detail.newValue));
});
```

### Expressing Reactive Elements Without Components (`Fluxel.reactive`)

Normally in Fluxel, to define reactive elements, you use the `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent` function.
By using `Fluxel.reactive`, which is also an internal function, it's possible to introduce a reactive scope without creating a full component.

```ts
import Fluxel from "fluxel/reactive";

const reactiveButton = Fluxel.div({
  children: Fluxel.reactive({ count: 0 }, state => (
    Fluxel.button({
      children: state.use("count", count => `Count: ${count}`),
      onclick: () => state.count++,
      classList: ["reactive-button"]
    })
  ))
});
```

It is particularly useful when the responsibility is too small to be extracted as an independent component, or when it is intended for one-time use in a specific location. This eliminates the need to define a separate component file and allows reactive logic to be written directly near the code.

### Memoization when using `ReactiveDependency` as `Props` (`state.useWithMemo`)

`state.useWithMemo` is a special function that is generally not recommended for direct use. In typical cases, the form `state.use("key", (value, memo) => { /* ... */ })` is sufficient, and the `memo` function is used to reduce the overhead of derived functions (which are called whenever a value changes) tied to the state.

However, in the following specific scenarios, `state.useWithMemo` can be helpful in solving problems.

**Use Case:**

When a parent component passes the result of `state.use` (a `ReactiveDependency` object) as props to a child component, and within that child component, you want to perform a derivation related to the received `ReactiveDependency` and memoize its result.

In this situation, if the parent component generates the child component like `state.use("key", (value, memo) => <ChildComponent someProp={value} MemoizeFunction={memo} />)`, the entire child component will be regenerated every time the parent's state changes. This is highly inefficient and inconvenient because the child component itself doesn't necessarily need to be regenerated just because the state changed.

**Solution with `state.useWithMemo`:**

To solve this problem, `state.useWithMemo` allows you to obtain a `ReactiveDependency` and its associated `memo` function from the parent component side at once, and pass both as props to the child component.

```ts
// The simplified function signature of `state.useWithMemo`
state.useWithMemo<T, R>(
  key: keyof State, // State is the type of states of the component.
): [ReactiveDependency<T>, MemoizeFunction];
```

By passing the obtained `ReactiveDependency` and `memo` function as props to the child component, the child component can efficiently memoize its internal derived values using the received `memo` function, without being regenerated every time.

```tsx
import Fluxel, { type ReactiveDependency, type MemoizeFunction } from 'fluxel/jsx-reactive';

// Parent Component
const ParentComponent = Fluxel.createStatefulComponent((_, state) => {
  // Use state.useWithMemo to get ReactiveDependency and memo function simultaneously
  const [messageDep, MemoizeFunction] = state.useWithMemo('message');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Parent component</h1>
      <p>Message of parent component: {state.use('message')}</p>
      {/* Pass ReactiveDependency and MemoizeFunction to child component */}
      <ChildComponent messageDep={messageDep} MemoizeFunction={MemoizeFunction} />
      <button onclick={() => state.message = 'Updated from parent!'}>
        Update message (parent component)
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}, { message: 'Hello from parent!' });

// Child Component
// Accepts ReactiveDependency and MemoizeFunction as Props
interface ChildProps {
  messageDep: ReactiveDependency<string>;
  MemoizeFunction: MemoizeFunction;
}

const ChildComponent = Fluxel.createComponent((props: ChildProps) => {
  // Generate a memoized derived value using the received messageDep and MemoizeFunction
  const displayMessage = props.messageDep.derive((msg, memo) => {
    // By using MemoizeFunction, expensive calculations or DOM construction within this block can be memoized
    return memo(() => `Message of parent component received from parent: "${msg}"`, [msg]);
  });

  return (
    <div style={{ border: '1px solid gray', padding: '10px', marginTop: '10px' }}>
      <h2>Child component</h2>
      <p>{displayMessage}</p>
    </div>
  );
});

document.body.appendChild(Fluxel.ensureNode(<ParentComponent />));
```

**Reason for not recommending general use:**

Using `state.useWithMemo` outside of this specific use case is generally not recommended. It can lead to unexpected behavior and make code harder to understand, as the `memo` function exists independently of the reactive value.

## Type Definitions

The main exported types are as follows:

* **`ReactiveDependency<T>`**: A class representing a reactive value, enabling dependency tracking and derivation.

* **`ChildrenType<T>`**: Defines the diverse types of child elements that Fluxel elements can accept or return (strings, DOM nodes, reactive values, or arrays thereof).

* **`FluxelComponent<P, R>`**: Defines the type of Fluxel's custom components. `P` is the type of Props, and `R` is the `ChildrenType` returned by the component.

* **`FluxelJSXElement`**: A single virtual type that JSX resolves to. It hides the recursive complexity of `ChildrenType` from TypeScript's type inference, optimizing performance while maintaining type safety.

* **`StateParam<T>`**: The type of the state object passed to the renderer function of `Fluxel.createStatefulComponent`. Reactive values can be obtained and updated using the `use` method or by directly accessing properties.
